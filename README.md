# Hand Written Text Recognition System

# Objective

Develop a deep learning-based handwriting recognition system that works with both pens and screens. Analyze different handwriting styles, from simple notes to complex forms, across languages and dialects. Use a large dataset to create an advanced and adaptable model. Our goal is to integrate with applications that can take advantage of handwritten data, such as document digitization, accessibility software, and automated form-filling techniques. Develop and implement a deep learning architecture capable of providing extremely accurate handwriting recognition across many domains. Examine each character, phrase, and sentence for style alterations, language shifts, and complexity.
